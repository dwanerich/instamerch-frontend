INSTACOVER APP

The Application was inspired by the love for music, album cover and art.
Instacover is a clean, fun single page application(SPA) showcasing backend logic, AJAX requests, DOM manipulation & third party Spotify API utilization.

INSTACOVER is an application that allows users to login, quick search album covers by artist name or album. Album covers searches are instantly listed below with a user option to click on their desired cover. By clicking on this cover it's added to a board for all to see you can repeat the process over & over again til you have a wall of the best album covers of all time. However by clicking on the covers on the wall of covers will fire off a delete action and the album will both disappear fro the DOM and be deleted from the database / backend. You can repeat this action as well until you have zero albums displaying on the board.

Albums consist of a "title" an "image url" and a "liked by" attribute.
